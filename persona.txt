quote="I try to drink 1.5L a day, I always have my bottle with me. What I missed was a camelback. You can quickly waste time. It’s not practical, they give you a cup with water during the race but it’s not practical. For the training, I will train with my camelback and for the long races I will have water with me."


story="Pierre, 34, is a French marketing manager in Paris who runs 3-4 times weekly. He views running as both fitness and meditation. Pierre prefers social running, often meeting friends for 8-15 km runs. He recently completed his first marathon, finding it challenging due to inadequate preparation, especially for hydration. Like others, he's experienced dehydration issues on longer runs. Pierre plans to improve his training consistency, focus on proper hydration, and prepare better for future races. He enjoys local 10k and half-marathon events, and uses running to clear his mind after work"
