1. Impact of Dehydration on Physical and Mental Performance

 -Dehydration significantly affects athletic performance, even with a small loss of body water. A sweat loss equal to just 2% of body weight can noticeably reduce both physical and mental performance. 

2. Physiological Effects of Dehydration on Cardiovascular and Muscular Systems
-Dehydration affects blood volume and viscosity, which in turn impacts cardiac output, reducing the heart's ability to pump blood effectively during physical exertion. It also leads to increased core temperature, reduced skin blood flow, and an increased rate of glycogen use, leading to quicker fatigue. These physiological effects hinder an athlete's ability to maintain high performance and make the body more prone to early exhaustion, highlighting the importance of hydration for cardiovascular health and endurance.

3. Hydrationâ€™s Role in Muscle Growth and Recovery
-Dehydration increases cortisol levels, which reduces testosterone, a key hormone required for muscle growth and recovery. This results in reduced muscle gains from resistance training. 

4.Water is involved in the majority of chemical reactions involved in athletic performance. It is important that athletes are hydrated before, during and after physical activity to achieve their maximal physical performance.

5.An increased core temperature during a dehydrated state is accompanied by a larger aromatic amine response, possibly leading to an increased rate of glycogen breakdown in muscles. An increased rate of glycogen breakdown may contribute to an increased level of fatigue in the muscles used during the athletic activity
